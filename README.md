## $\color{green}{Technical}$

- Architecture: The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which promotes a clear separation of concerns and facilitates easier testing and scalability.

- Clean Architecture: The app is structured using the Clean Architecture principles, separating the application into distinct layers - Presentation, Domain, and Data - to achieve modularity and maintainability.

- User Interface: The user interface is built using Jetpack Compose, a modern Android UI toolkit that simplifies and accelerates UI development through a declarative approach.

- Navigation: The Navigation component is employed to manage navigation within the app. It provides a consistent and predictable way to navigate between different screens.

- UI Components: The app features a Tab Layout for organizing content and enhancing user navigation between different sections.

- Network Communication: Retrofit is employed for handling network requests. It provides a convenient and efficient way to communicate with APIs and retrieve data from remote servers.

- Concurrency: Coroutines are used to manage asynchronous operations and simplify concurrency handling. They enable smoother execution of tasks without blocking the main thread.

- Dependency Injection: Hilt is utilized for dependency injection. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies and enhances the testability and maintainability of the codebase.

- Error Handling: Network errors are gracefully managed, with Retrofit checking HTTP responses and displaying user-friendly messages, exception handling prevents crashes by catching and logging unexpected errors, enhancing app stability.

- Image Loading: Images are loaded efficiently using the Coil library, which handles image caching and loading with ease.

- Animations: Lottie animations are integrated into the app to provide visually appealing and interactive animations that enhance the user experience.
